# If You’re Doing Everything Yourself, You’re Doing It Wrong.

You don’t need more time.  
You need fewer tasks.

---

## You’re the Founder, Right?

You built the site. You take the calls. You answer the emails. You send the invoices. You book the meetings. You update the damn spreadsheet.

You're “hustling.”  
But let’s call it what it is — *manual labor in a digital business*.

And it’s costing you.

Not just time.  
**Focus. Energy. Output. Growth.**

## Look What One Bot Can Do

This repo?  
It’s *Agent Mike* — a full-blown AI admin assistant for real estate.

- Answers all FAQs  
- Sends property info + pricing  
- Books viewings  
- Manages leads, buyers, renters, agents  
- Follows up  
- Even closes deals

It’s not a product. It’s not for sale.  
**It’s a wake-up call.**

---

## You Could Build This. Today. With Tools You Already Know.

Mike runs on:
- Python  
- LangChain  
- A brain (OpenAI)  
- A calendar + a CRM  
- And a tiny bit of logic

That’s it.

No 12-person dev team. No investor. No co-founder.  
Just code and clarity.

## Stop Looking for an Assistant.

Build One.

You don’t need to “delegate” anymore.
You need to automate.

You’re not lazy.
You’re overloaded.
And bots don’t burn out.

---

## So Here’s the Real Pitch:

This repo isn’t just a demo.
It’s a new way of thinking.

If you’re a solo founder or working professional —
You can either…

1. Keep doing all the admin by hand
2. Or spend 5-10 hours setting up your own Agent Mike

You’ll never go back.
